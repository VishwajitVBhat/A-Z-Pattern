Pattern A to Z in Java

This project prints alphabet patterns from A to Z using Java.
Each letter is displayed using * symbols in a 5x5 grid format.

Project Description

The program demonstrates:

Nested for loops

Conditional statements (if-else)

Pattern printing logic

Basic Java console output formatting

Each alphabet (A–Z) is printed using structured loop logic to form recognizable letter patterns.

Technologies Used

Java

Eclipse / IntelliJ / VS Code (Any Java IDE)

JDK 8 or above
